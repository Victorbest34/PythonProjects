This project is part of a Data Science virtual internship program in collaboration with British Airways, offered by Forage. 
The project involves the following key tasks:
1. Web Scraping for Company Insights: The first task is to perform web scraping to gather valuable insights about the airline industry. 
This involves extracting and analyzing airline reviews. The results of this analysis will be summarized in a single PowerPoint slide.

2. Predicting Customer Buying Behavior: The second task revolves around exploring customer booking data. To better understand the factors 
that influence customer buying behavior, a random forest model will be built. The findings will be presented in another PowerPoint slide.

Objective:
The main goal of this internship is to apply analytical skills to make a real impact on multi-million-pound business decisions. 
This will be achieved through the development of recommendations, tools, and models that drive essential business choices, cut costs, 
and boost revenue.
Technologies:
The project will utilize Python for data analysis and manipulation. Airline reviews will be scraped from the Skytrax platform 
and stored in a file named "BA_reviews.csv." Customer booking data will be sourced from "customer_booking.csv."
